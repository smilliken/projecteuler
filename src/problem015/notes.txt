40 total moves determine a path. If these moves were distinct and
independent then there would be 40! possible paths. The "down" moves
are not distinct however, and this overcounts by a factor of 20!
(and likewise for "right" moves). So the total number of paths is
40!/(20! * 20!). Alternatively, it can be viewed as 40 choose 20
possible paths.
